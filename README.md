I am Jordan Hanks a Veteran of the Army that just recently moved to California to start a new adventure! I am Married with 2 kids, 1 girl (10 yrs) and 1 boy (7 yrs). I served 6 years in the military, 2 years serving as Land Combat Electronic Missile Systems Repairer and the last 4 years as an All Source Intelligence Analyst. We moved across the country from North Carolina to the Bay area in seearch of new and better opportunities. I am a very self-driven person that only wants to succeed in life and create a great future for my family. I will always continue to grow in anyway possible whether that be work, family, or just being a good person in general. </p>

<p> My transition from the position I held in the military and what my current full-time job is to trying to become a web developer is not easy. These are two completley different worlds. I believe that their are vast amounts of opportunities out there in the world for individuals who know how to and are good at web development. My wife and I goal is to become web developers together, her doing front end and myself doing back end. This would allow us the freedom to work from home anywhere in the world essentially. <a href="https://www.groupon.com/browse/orange-county?topcategory=travel">Groupon (Travel)</a> I like this website becasue my family loves to travel and explore new things. I feel like everyone should experiences new cultures and just the way of life in different places. Groupon always has tons of deals on vacations especially if your a person with a flexible schedule. </p>
